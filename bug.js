This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` method before the camera has finished initializing.  The `Camera` component's `onCameraReady` prop is crucial for handling asynchronous operations, which is often overlooked.  The application might crash or produce unexpected behavior due to this asynchronous initialization process not being properly managed.
